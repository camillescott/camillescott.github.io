Graduate student, bioinformatician, troublemaker, etc. I'm studying at UC Davis under the guidance
of [Titus Brown](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog) in the 
[Lab for Data Intensive Biology](http://ivory.idyll.org/lab). We do stuff with nucleotide 
and occasionally amino acid sequences, preferably in large quantity and either transcriptomic
or metagenomic in origin. We also do a lot of teaching, which you read more about [here](http://dib-training.readthedocs.org/en/pub/) and [here](http://ged.msu.edu/angus/); some materials that I've
written can be found on my github, such as this nifty [pydoit workshop](http://ged.msu.edu/angus/),
or on our various readthedocs sites.

After a long while working on the [lamprey transcriptome](https://github.com/dib-lab/2015-petMarSB),
I found myself frustrated with the state of existing transcriptome annotators and wrote
[dammit](http://www.camillescott.org/dammit/). I've contributed extensively to our lab's
sequence analysis library, [khmer](https://github.com/dib-lab/khmer), and have a pile of other
repos on my github page. For example, once I got bored and decided to learn flask, and ended
up writing [pipecleaner](http://pipecleaner.camillescott.org/), a web app for the legendary
time-gobbling vortex Eve Online.

Out in the real world I emulate a normal person by playing with my cat, making music, and 
enjoying Star Trek.
