title: Profiling C++ Extensions with Yep
---

### Intro

For those of you who work with both the python codebase and the `c++`
backend, I found a pretty useful tool. Seeing as we work with
performance-sensitive software, profiling is very useful; but, it can be
a pain to profile our `c++` code when called through python, which
necessitates writing `c++` wrappers to functions for basic profiling.
The solution I found is called
[yep](http://fa.bianp.net/blog/2011/a-profiler-for-python-extensions),
which is a python module made specifically to profile `c++` python
extensions. 

### Installation

In order to install, simply run:

{% highlight console %}

sudo apt-get install google-perftools
sudo apt-get install python-dbg
pip install yep

{% endhighlight %}

For khmer, you should also be sure to turn on debugging at compile time:

{% highlight console %}

cd /path/to/khmer
make debug

{% endhighlight %}

The first is the python module implementing the profiler; the second is
the tool for analyzing the resulting profile information.

### Usage

There are a couple ways to use it. You can call it directly from the
command line with:

{% highlight console %}

python -m yep [options] -- /path/to/script [args ... ]

{% endhighlight %}

The `--` is necessary, as it tells UNIX not to parse the resulting
arguments as flag arguments, which allows the profiler to pass them on
to the script being profiled instead of choking on them itself. Thanks
for this trick, @mr-c. Also make sure to use the absolute path to the
script to be profiled.

You can also use the module directly in your code, with:

{% highlight py %}

import yep
yep.start('outname')
# <code to profile...>
yep.stop()

{% endhighlight %}

The resulting file is then visualized using google-pprof, with:

{% highlight console %}

google-pprof --gif <python executable> <profile> > prof.gif

{% endhighlight %}

In order to get python debugging symbols, you need to use the debugging
executable. So, while you may run the script in your virtualenv if using
one, you give google-pprof the debug executable so it can properly
construct callgraphs:

{% highlight console %}

python -m yep -- /w/khmer/scripts/sweep-reads-by-partition-buffered.py \
 -k 25 -x 1e9 -o test_sweep -i /w/tests/test-sweep-contigs.fp \
/w/tests/test-sweep-reads.fa
google-pprof --gif /usr/bin/python2.7-dbg \
 sweep-reads-by-partition-buffer.py.prof > prof.gif

{% endhighlight %}

### Results

Here is some example output:

![](/public/prof.png)


In this call graph, the python debugging symbols were not properly
included; this is resolved by using the debugging executable.

The call graph is in standard form, where the first percentage is the
time in that particular function alone, and where the second percentage
is the time in all functions called by that function. See the
[description](http://google-perftools.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/cpuprofile.html)
for more details.

And that's it. Happy profiling!
