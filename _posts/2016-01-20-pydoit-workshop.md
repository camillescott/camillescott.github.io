title: pydoit half-day workshop debrief

### About

Earlier today I taught a half-day workshop introducing students to 
[doit](http://pydoit.org/) for automating their workflows and building applications.
This was an intermediate-level python workshop, in that it expected students to have
operational python knowledge. The [materials](http://www.camillescott.org/pydoit-intermediate/)
are freely available, and the workshop was live-streamed on YouTube, where it is
[still available](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfD9bWmL-1M).

This workshop was part of a series being put on by our lab the next few quarters. A
longer list of the workshops is at the [dib training site](http://dib-training.readthedocs.org/en/pub/), and Titus has [written](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2015-training-for-q12-2016.html) on them [before](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2015-3hr-remote-workshops.html).

### Outcome

Overall, I was happy with the results. Between the on-site participants and live-stream
viewers, our attendance was okay (about ten people total), and all students communicated
that they enjoyed the workshop and found it informative. Most of my materials (which I
mostly wrote from scratch) seemed to parse well, with the exception of a few minor bugs
which I caught during the lesson and was able to fix. As per usual, our training
coordinator [Jessica](https://twitter.com/jessicamizzi) did a great job handling the
logistics, and we were able to use of the brand new Data Science Initiative space in
the Shields Library on the UC Davis campus.

### Thoughts for the Future

We did have a number of no-shows, which was disappointing. My intuition is that this
was caused by a mixture of it being the beginning of the quarter here, with many
students, postdocs, staff, and faculty just returning, and the more advanced nature
of the material, which tends to scare folks away. It might be another piece of data
to support the idea of charging five bucks or so for tickets to require a small amount
of activation energy and thus filter out likely no-shows, but we've had good luck so
far with attendance, and it'd be best to make such a decision after we run a few more
similar workshops (perhaps it would only need to be done for the intermediate or 
advanced ones, for example).

We also had several students with installation issues, a recurring problem for these
sorts of events. I'm leaning toward trying out browser-based approaches in the future,
which would allow me to set up configurations ahead of time (likely via docker files)
and short-circuit the usual cross-platform, python distribution, and software
installation issues.

I really enjoyed the experience, as this was the first workshop I've run where
I created all the materials myself. I'm looking forward to doing more in the future.

ps. this has been my first post in a long time, and I'm hoping to keep them flowing.
