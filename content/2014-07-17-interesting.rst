After a rather unsavory series of comments from one of the editors of Science
Careers, and the twitter storm that followed, I've been motivated to write. First,
the background. Science recently ran a `special issue <http://www.sciencemag.org/content/345/6193.toc#SpecialIssue>`__ on Strategies against HIV/AIDS. The cover of this issue depicts several transgender sex workers, from
the neck down, in revealing clothing, along with a blurb about high risk groups. Cue Jim Austin and his
twitter comments. Let's begin with one to set the tone:

    *Interesting to consider how those gazey males will feel when they find out."* -- Jim Austin, @SciCareerEditor

Interesting is the operative word of the day. Given that this was in response to the pictured
womens' trans status, perhaps Mr. Austin thinks it's *interesting* how often trans women
are raped, assaulted, and murdered because of such men "finding out." Or
perhaps it's more *interesting* to observe the casual transphobia displayed by men in positions
of privilege like himself. After all,

    *You realize they are transgender? Does it matter? That at least colors things, no?* -- Jim Austin, @SciCareerEditor

Why yes, it does color things, and in very *interesting* ways. There is a long and
very colorful history of the relationship between trans people and scientists.
We could consider that scientists 
who found trans women *interesting* in the 70's and 80's helped set back trans rights by decades. 
We could consider that scientists who found trans women *interesting* created a conception of 
trans women being shallow and manipulative by writing as such in their articles, because trans women 
were only okayed for treatment by those same scientists if they acted out those stereotypes. 
We could consider that scientists
and lawyers who found trans women *interesting* created a healthcare system that, for decades, made it
almost impossible for trans women to get treatment. We could consider that
scientists who find trans women *interesting* have continually used us as lab rats to
publish poorly-supported sexist conclusions on the differences between gendered brains,
with no visible knowledge gain given back to the trans community.

Or for things our esteemed editor might consider less *interesting*, we could consider that actions
like the recent one only further the common conception that trans women of color
are good for nothing but satisfying the sexual desires of men (but make sure we call it "raising 
awareness" so people can think this reinforcement is noble). We could consider that many
trans women are denied careers in fields like, say, science, because of these
stereotypes. Or we could consider that many trans women are denied careers outright because
of these stereotypes.

And I haven't even talked about the cover yet! I'm not sure I need to; it's been discussed
`elsewhere <http://scientopia.org/blogs/drugmonkey/2014/07/16/does-science-magazine-actually-sell-many-copies-at-the-newsstand/>`__ quite nicely.
But I can talk about trans representation in science, and even in Science. How about instead
of once again pointing out the public health concerns of trans sex workers, we have a special issue
on the pressures that force so many trans women into sex work in the first place? Or on
the false notions of LGBT people being the root cause of sexually transmitted diseases?
Or, a special issue of articles written by all trans scientists?

We are not your lab rats. We are not your charitable tax writeoff. We are not your
fetish objects. We *are* scientists, we *are* mothers, we *are* students, teachers,
lawyers, doctors, sex workers, dock workers, factory workers, social workers,
musicians, artists. We are people. And we are more than "interesting."
