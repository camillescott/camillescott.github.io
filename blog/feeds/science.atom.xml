&lt;p&gt;Why, you might ask, are we at the Mountains of Madness?
To begin, I'll provide a quote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Bioinformatics is like being slowly bitten to death by ants.&lt;/em&gt; --&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog"&gt;C. Titus Brown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spend some time trying to assemble a highly polymorphic genome, or fumbling around
the NCBI database, and you'll understand why we're at the Mountains of Madness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all seriousness, this blog is intended to be about bioinformatics, and my work
in it. I am a second-year PhD student at Michigan State University, working in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ged.msu.edu"&gt;GED Lab&lt;/a&gt; under Titus Brown.
When we're not exploring the Mountains of Madness, hoping the Old Ones will provide insights
into assembly or reveal to us better probabilistic data structures, our lab spends a
lot of time discussing the utility of maintaining an online presence in science; this is
my foray into that realm! With any luck, I hope to update regularly. Aside from the obvious
benefits of networking with others in the field and staking my claim in the research world,
a blog has the secondary benefit of giving a set goal to work toward -- having something
concrete to write about in a semi-formal way, on a semi-monthly or more basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To kick things off, a post on my recent experience at the Marine Biological Lab will be coming soon!
I'll talk about some lessons learned, my thoughts on teaching computational skills to biologists,
and provide a small exercise in assembly that we used. Until then,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Camille&lt;/p&gt;
